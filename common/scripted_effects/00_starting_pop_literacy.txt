# Original vanilla comment
### NOTE: This file only exist to set a baseline for the simulation, the ACTUAL literacy of pops is calculated during setup so starting literacy January 1, 1836 will NOT match the values set in this file

# I believe that starting literacy is now determined by either POP wealth or SOL.
# These scripts are a holdover from when the v3 engine drew its literacy and wealth rates from effects in the history files.
# POP wealth is the main constituent of a POPs SOL.
# POP wealth is calculated by the intializewealth function that appears to assign wealth based on income in perfect market conditions for all buildings.
# This leads to oddities like Sardinia-Piedmont having the worst literacy rate in Italy and Two Sicilies the best.
# It's no wonder that Italy is ahistorically formed by Two Sicilies in almost any playthrough with a unified Italy.
# Various countries end up technologically kneecapped by this, and it goes against intended design.
# Example of this:
## # Examples: Sweden, Netherlands
##effect_starting_pop_literacy_very_high
# The intitializewealth function actually seems to cause the Netherlands to have a similar literacy rate to Spain.
# So I have re-purposed these effects to re-calculate global literacy rates to be more historical and in line with the original game concept written in these comments.
# I have also added a discriminated trigger to decrease the literacy rate of discriminated POPs.
# Now the Austrian Empire won't have the same literacy rate through its empire.
