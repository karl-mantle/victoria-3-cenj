# Feature List

* This isn't complete

## Buildings

- New Buildings: Brickworks, Cement Factory, Chemicals Factory, Explosives Industry, Hospitals (WIP), Mines and Fields (Copper and Silver), Quarries, Finance Sector and Mints
- Buildings are now half their vanilla size, other values have been adjusted to compensate e.g. arable land, mesh_per_level etc.
- Infrastructure has not been doubled to force AI and player to build the new Road Network building and railways
- Construction and Ports can now be fully privatised - construction produces securities goods (to represent property deeds/mortgages) and ports produce charterparties (shipping contracts for the convoys)
- Construction Sector PMs overhauled to require different goods and added a new PM (Masonry Buildings)

## Goods and Trade

- Various new goods for the new buildings and PMs e.g. copper, newspapers, literature, cement, bricks, securities
- Added POP needs for appropriate goods
- Ports now produce charterparties which are needed for maritime trade
- Trade centers can also use transport or automobiles directly for convoys
- POPs now have financial needs and will consume currency and securities

## Cultures

- American and Canadian diapora cultures such as Italian American, Texan, Newfoundlander and Scottish Canadian.
- Regional variations of French, Italian and German cultures will assimilate automatically to their mother cultures when nationalism and/or pan-nationalism has been researched, e.g. Austro-Bavarians in a South German state will assimilate to South German when nationalism is researched. When pan-nationalism is researched they will assimilate to German inside a German state. If a German minor is not unified in to Germany, then they will take their regional culture as a primary culture e.g. Austria > Austro-Bavarian or Luxembourg > Franconian.
- French culture now has regional variations e.g. Norman or Gallo
- Italian culture now has regional variations e.g. Ligurian, Roman, Venetian, etc.
- German culture now has regional variations e.g. Baltic German, Franconian, Swabian, etc.
- Ugrian culture split into various Fenno-Ugric cultures e.g. Veps, Karelian, etc.
- Caucasian culture split into various cultures e.g. Chechen, Nogai, Ossetian
- Other regional cultures around the world e.g. Griqua, Scanian, Cornish

## Flavour

- New historical characters for new and existing tags
