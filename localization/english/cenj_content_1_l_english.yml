Our troops call for his immediate execution, in response for the massacres at the Alamo and Goliad, but General Houston, wounded in the leg during the battle, believes that in exchange for his release, we can press him to sign a treaty recognizing Texan independance immediately."

The growth of Texas's popluation in recent years has only caused an increase in the frequency of raids.\n\nStephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas", originally organized a small group of 10 men to serve as rangers and protect frontier families. Last year, our state extended and formally founded the Texas Rangers to this same end, but the power of Comancheria, and recent raids, like the one at Fort Parker, demand the state address the threat head on.\n\nTwo candidates for president are offering competing ideas on how to approach the Comanche. General [SCOPE.sCharacter('sam_houston_scope').GetFullName], hero of the revolution, lived for a time with various tribes previously in Indian Territory, and advocates for peaceful co-existence. [SCOPE.sCharacter('mirabeau_lamar_scope').GetFullName] on the other hand, believes that the army must be strengthened and the Comanche must be driven back by force."

The original treaty set the borders of the two nations along the Red and Arkansas Rivers, and the 100th meridian.\n\nThe Treaty of Velasco we signed with Mexico was ambigous, but can be interpreted to having us lay claim to everything north and east of the Río Bravo del Norte.
